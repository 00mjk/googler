# Note

Initially I raised a pull request but I could see that the last change was made 7 years earlier. In addition, there is no GitHub activity from the author in past year. I have created this independent repo for the project with the name google-cli. Would love to push the changes back to original repo if the author contacts. I retained the original copyright information.
